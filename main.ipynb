       "'- Human anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of the human body and relationships among its parts.\\n- It is one of the oldest sciences, originating in ancient Egypt and Greece.\\n- Anatomy forms the foundation for medicine, physiology, and biological sciences related to human life.\\n- Studying anatomy helps understand body system interactions and effects of diseases or injuries.\\n\\nLevels of Structural Organization:\\n- Chemical level: atoms and molecules form the building blocks of life.\\n- Cellular level: cells are the smallest units of life capable of independent function.\\n- Tissue level: groups of similar cells with common functions (e.g., muscle tissue, nervous tissue).\\n- Organ level: tissues combine to form organs (e.g., heart, lungs, liver) with specific tasks.\\n- Organ system level: multiple organs work together in systems.\\n- Organism level: all organ systems together form the human body.\\n\\nMajor Organ Systems:\\n1. Integumentary System: skin, hair, nails, glands; protects, regulates temperature, prevents dehydration, sensory perception.\\n2. Skeletal System: 206 bones, cartilage, ligaments, joints; support, shape, movement, mineral storage, blood cell production.\\n3. Muscular System: skeletal, cardiac, smooth muscles; movement, posture, heat production.\\n4. Nervous System: brain, spinal cord, nerves; coordinates activities, processes sensory info, controls thought, emotion, memory.\\n5. Endocrine System: glands secreting hormones; regulates growth, metabolism, reproduction, mood.\\n6. Cardiovascular System: heart, blood vessels; transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, removes waste.\\n7. Lymphatic System: lymph nodes, vessels, spleen; fluid balance, fat absorption, immune defense.\\n8. Respiratory System: nose, trachea, lungs, diaphragm; gas exchange, oxygen supply, carbon dioxide removal.\\n9. Digestive System: mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas; breaks down food, nutrient absorption.\\n10. Urinary System: kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra; removes waste, maintains fluid and electrolyte balance, regulates pH.\\n11. Reproductive System: male (testes, ducts), female (ovaries, uterus); reproduction, hormone production affecting development.\\n\\nAnatomical Terminology and Body Organization:\\n- Anatomical position: standing upright, facing forward, arms at sides, palms outward.\\n- Directional terms: anterior (front), posterior (back), superior (above), inferior (below).\\n- Body planes: sagittal (left-right), frontal (front-back), transverse (top-bottom) for internal visualization.\\n\\nHomeostasis and Interdependence:\\n- Organ systems interact to maintain internal balance (homeostasis) essential for survival.\\n- Systems work together (e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular deliver oxygen; nervous and endocrine coordinate responses).\\n- Failure in one system affects others, causing illness or dysfunction.\\n- Anatomy involves dynamic relationships sustaining life and function.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n- Human anatomy reveals complex, coordinated body design from cells to organ systems.\\n- Understanding anatomy is crucial for medicine, biology, and health professions.\\n- It underpins knowledge of physiology, pathology, and clinical practice.\\n- The human body is a remarkable, enduring natural marvel with billions of interacting components.'"

    "\n",
    "# ### 🎓 **Transcript: The Human Female Sexual Organ**\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Good morning, everyone.\n",
    "# 2. Today, we’ll be learning about the **human female sexual organs**.\n",
    "# 3. This topic is part of our reproductive health education.\n",
    "# 4. The female reproductive system has both **external** and **internal** organs.\n",
    "# 5. Each organ has a special role in reproduction and overall health.\n",
    "# 6. Let’s start with the **external organs**, also known as the **vulva**.\n",
    "# 7. The vulva is the part you can see from the outside of the body.\n",
    "# 8. It includes several structures working together for protection and sensation.\n",
    "# 9. The **mons pubis** is the soft, fatty area above the pubic bone.\n",
    "# 10. It becomes covered with hair after puberty.\n",
    "# 11. Below it are the **labia majora**, or “outer lips.”\n",
    "# 12. These folds of skin protect the inner parts of the vulva.\n",
    "# 13. Inside them are the **labia minora**, or “inner lips.”\n",
    "# 14. They are more delicate and vary in size and color between individuals.\n",
    "# 15. In the upper part of the vulva, you’ll find the **clitoris**.\n",
    "# 16. The clitoris is a small, sensitive organ important for sexual pleasure.\n",
    "# 17. It contains many nerve endings — more than any other part of the body.\n",
    "# 18. The **urethral opening** lies just below the clitoris.\n",
    "# 19. This is where urine passes out of the body.\n",
    "# 20. Beneath it is the **vaginal opening**, also called the **introitus**.\n",
    "# 21. The vaginal opening leads into the **vagina**, an internal muscular canal.\n",
    "# 22. The vagina connects the external genitals to the uterus inside the body.\n",
    "# 23. It also serves as the passage for menstrual flow and childbirth.\n",
    "# 24. Now let’s move on to the **internal organs**.\n",
    "# 25. The first internal structure is the **vagina**, as we just mentioned.\n",
    "# 26. It’s followed by the **cervix**, which is the lower part of the uterus.\n",
    "# 27. The cervix opens slightly to allow menstrual blood to flow out.\n",
    "# 28. During childbirth, it expands to let the baby pass through.\n",
    "# 29. Above the cervix is the **uterus**, also known as the womb.\n",
    "# 30. The uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ made of strong muscles.\n",
    "# 31. This is where a fertilized egg can implant and grow into a baby.\n",
    "# 32. The lining of the uterus thickens each month in preparation for pregnancy.\n",
    "# 33. If pregnancy doesn’t occur, this lining sheds during menstruation.\n",
    "# 34. On either side of the uterus are two **fallopian tubes**.\n",
    "# 35. The fallopian tubes transport eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.\n",
    "# 36. Fertilization — when the sperm meets the egg — usually happens in these tubes.\n",
    "# 37. At the end of each tube are tiny, finger-like projections called **fimbriae**.\n",
    "# 38. The fimbriae help guide the egg into the tube after ovulation.\n",
    "# 39. Finally, we have the **ovaries** — one on each side of the uterus.\n",
    "# 40. The ovaries produce **eggs** (or ova) and important hormones like estrogen and progesterone.\n",
    "# 41. These hormones control the menstrual cycle and female body development.\n",
    "# 42. Together, these organs form a system that supports reproduction and hormonal balance.\n",
    "# 43. It’s important to remember that every woman’s anatomy can look slightly different.\n",
    "# 44. All variations are normal as long as the organs are healthy.\n",
    "# 45. Maintaining reproductive health involves hygiene, medical checkups, and understanding your body.\n",
    "# 46. The female reproductive system also plays roles beyond reproduction, such as hormone regulation.\n",
    "# 47. It influences emotions, skin health, and bone strength.\n",
    "# 48. Learning about these organs helps us respect and care for our bodies better.\n",
    "# 49. Always feel free to ask questions about reproductive health without embarrassment.\n",
    "# 50. That’s all for today’s lesson on the human female sexual organs.\n",
